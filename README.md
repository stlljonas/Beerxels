# Beerxels

Disclaimer: This is a personal project and it works, but proceed with caution.

I have provided a sample image and a result in the files.
The computation is of complexity O(n^3), coming from the munkres algorithm implementation I used, and took about an hour for n=500 bottle caps.

Future Plans are to rewrite the code in C++ wth the hope of drastically reducing computational time.
