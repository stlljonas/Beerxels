# Beerxels

Disclaimer: This is a personal project, it is very messy and noone should seriously use this code.

That being said, it DOES work. 
I have provided a sample image and a result in the files.
The computation is of complexity O(n^3), coming from the munkres algorithm implementation I used, and took about an hour for n=500 bottle caps.

Proceed with caution
